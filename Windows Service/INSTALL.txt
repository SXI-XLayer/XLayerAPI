INSTALLATION
============

Follow the steps outlined below to get the XLayerAPI installed as a windows service.

1. Make sure you have Oracle Java JDK 13.02 installed (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html)
2. Unzip this archive to X:\SXI\XLayerAPI
3. Edit the XLayerAPI.xml configuration file that "spring.config.location" argument in the "arguments" element is pointing to the directory you extracted the archive to in the above step. (e.g. X:\SXI\XLayerAPI)
4. Open a command prompt as Administrator
5. Change directory to X:\SXI\XLayerAPI
6. Run the following: XLayerAPI.exe install

You can check in the "Services" Management Console that you now have a new Windows Service called "XLayerAPI".

CONFIGURATION
=============

1. XLayerAPI sends all its transactions to a database.  Depending on which database you use (either MySQL/MariaDB or MSSQL Server/Express)
	Connect to the database and run the relevant init.sql script to create the database (|init_MYSQL.sql or init_MSSQL.sql)
		NOTE: you do not need to create any tables as the XLayerAPI will automatically do this for you if they do not already exist.
2. The default database is MySQL / MariaDB however should you wish to use a MSSQL or a MSSQLExpress database then comment out the configuration in the application.properties file 
under the comment 

	#===============================================================================
	# MYSQL / MARIADB Database Settings
	# NOTE:
	#   COMMENT OUT this configuration if you wish to use a MS database
	#  (NB Make sure you uncomment the MSSQL settings below.
	#===============================================================================

and uncomment the configuration under the comment

	#===============================================================================
	# MSSQL Server / SQLExpress Database Settings
	# NOTE:
	#   UNCOMMENT if you wish to use a MS database (NB Make sure you comment out the
	#   MySQL settings above.
	#===============================================================================

3. Should you wish to change some of the default settings for XLayerAPI you can do so in the application.properties file.
		NOTE: Once you have made changes to this file you will need to restart the application.

4. Other settings that should be checked are:

sync.transaction.timeout   - This is the number of seconds the session will waid for a response before sending a failed message to the client. (Default 60 seconds)
server.port                - This is the port that the XLayerAPI will listen on. (Default = 9788)
spring.datasource.url      - The MYSQL connection string needed to connect to the "sxirestapi" database. (Default = jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST:localhost}:3306/sxirestapi)
						   - or -
						   - The MSSQL connection string needed to connect to the "sxirestapi" database. (Default = jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=sxirestapi)
	                         
NB: If you want to use a different database name then simply change "sxirestapi" to the name you wish to use in the init.sql file and in the connection string.
